# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Development Notes

- The project flow is: ./public/index.html has a div tag with id='root'. Root is referenced in ./src/index.tsx that generate the ReactDom with App.tsx.
- When I create a Component, I have to follow good development practices. The name of Component always will begin Upper Case.
- The Botao and Formulario Components were created based in Class Component (old way).
- The most up-to-date way is Function Component how can we look in Lista component.
